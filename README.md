# 2016 Olympic Games Dataset

## Introduction
Ιn this project data visualization is done using the matplotlib package of python. The dataset used is the following ([dataset](https://github.com/katetotka/plt_sports_visualization/blob/main/summer2016.csv)) and it contains information about the number of medals won by some countries in the 2016 Olympic Games.


## Data Visualization

### Number of observations and gender distribution
The dataset contains 2014 observations. Αs shown in the diagram below, there are 1047 men and 967 women.

### Age Distribution
The majority of the Olympians are 15-28 years old while, as expected, few are those who are over 42 years old.

The age distribution separately for men and women follows the same pattern.

### Average weight for men and women
The average weight of women is 62 kg, while for most athletes their weight ranges from 55 to 78 kg. On the other hand, the average weight of men is 82 kg and most of them weigh from 67 to 97 kg.

### Let's find which is the average weight for each sport
As can be seen from the relevant diagram, the sports that have the largest average body weight are basketball, weightlifting, handball, water polo, wrestling, rowing, rugby sevens, judo volleyball and beach volleyball. However, it is necessary to mention that for almost all sports there is a large variation in terms of average weight.

### Now let's do the same for average height
In general, the average height is high for almost all the sports except from gymnastics. As it is obvious the athletes of basketball, volleyball, beach volleyball and water polo have the highest height.

### In general, is there a correlation between weight and height in this dataset?
From the diagram below, it seems that there is a positive relationship between weight and height. As weight increases, the height increases respectively.
